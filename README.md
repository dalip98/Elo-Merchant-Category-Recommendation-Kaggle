# Elo-Merchant-Category-Recommendation-Kaggle

Right now, Elo, one of the largest payment brands in Brazil, has built partnerships with merchants in order to offer promotions or discounts to cardholders. But do these promotions work for either the consumer or the merchant? Do customers enjoy their experience? Do merchants see repeat business? Personalization is key.

Elo has built machine learning models to understand the most important aspects and preferences in their customers’ lifecycle, from food to shopping. But so far none of them is specifically tailored for an individual or profile.

In this competition, I have developed some algorithms to identify and serve the most relevant opportunities to individuals, by uncovering signal in customer loyalty. Our input will improve customers’ lives and help Elo reduce unwanted campaigns, to create the right experience for customers.
